## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to establish communication between your Windows PC and an Arduino board to control an LED remotely. By following the steps in this guide, you'll be able to create your own custom lighting solutions, automation systems, or interactive projects.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- LED (Light Emitting Diode)
- Resistor (220-330 ohms)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- USB cable for connecting the Arduino to your PC
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) installed on your Windows PC
- A basic understanding of C# programming

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. Open the Windows application project in Visual Studio or your preferred C# development environment.

3. Upload the Arduino code provided in the [ArduinoCode](ArduinoCode/) directory to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE. This code defines the serial communication protocol between your PC and the Arduino.

4. Build and run the Windows application on your PC.

5. Connect your Arduino to your PC via USB.

6. Use the Windows application to send commands to control the LED connected to your Arduino.

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

- [WindowsApp/](WindowsApp/): Contains the C# Windows application code.

## Usage
To control the LED from your Windows PC, follow these steps:

1. Launch the Windows application.

2. Connect your Arduino to your PC via USB.

3. Select the COM port to which your Arduino is connected in the Windows application.

4. Use the application interface to send commands to the Arduino, controlling the LED's state.
